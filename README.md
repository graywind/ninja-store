Ninja Store
===========

**NOTE**: Requires Express 4.x

-----------
Ninja Store is a very simple Express.js app for you to hack around and understand Express better.

It is a good project to start learnig Express because if covers GET and POST requests, the Jade template engine, the Stylus CSS engine, login-logout, and sessions. All of it while being a tiny project.
